            <p>London Bridge is a historic and iconic bridge located over the River Thames in London, England. The current bridge, which opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel.</p> 
            <P>It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn superseded a 600-year-old stone-built medieval structure. Prior to these, there had been several timber bridges in the same location since the Roman period.</P>
